# Python Migration of ATTRACT.CBL

This repository contains the Python migration of the COBOL program `ATTRACT.CBL`.

## Program Description

This Python script calculates the gravitational attraction between two bodies in space, demonstrating the use of floating-point operations for scientific calculations.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pmgridd/cobol-samples.git
    cd cobol-samples
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Python project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd python/src/main/cobol/
    ```
3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python ATTRACT.py
    ```

The program will prompt you to enter the mass, velocity (vx, vy), and position (px, py) for two bodies. It will then calculate and display the distance between them, the force of attraction, and the force components along the X and Y axes.
